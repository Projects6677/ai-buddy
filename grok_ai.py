    You must generate four distinct pieces of content based on the data provided below and return them in a single JSON object with the keys: "greeting", "quote_explanation", "detailed_history", and "detailed_weather".

    1.  **Greeting Generation:**
        -   Today's known festival is: "{festival_name if festival_name else 'None'}".
        -   Task: Create a cheerful morning greeting.
        -   **Strict Rules:** If a festival_name is provided (e.g., "Raksha Bandhan"), you MUST generate a festive greeting for it. If festival_name is "None", you MUST generate a standard "Good Morning" greeting.
        -   Example (if festival is "Raksha Bandhan"): "Happy Raksha Bandhan, {user_name}!"
        -   Example (if festival is "None"): "‚òÄÔ∏è Good Morning, {user_name}!"

    2.  **Quote Analysis:**
        -   Quote: "{quote}" by {author}
        -   Task: Explain the meaning of this quote in one insightful sentence.

    3.  **Historical Event:**
        -   Events: {json.dumps(history_texts)}
        -   Task: Pick the most interesting event from the list and write an engaging 2-3 sentence summary about it.

    4.  **Weather Forecast:**
